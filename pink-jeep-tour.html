      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="story-content">
      <p class="story-text">
        He pushed harder on the twelve-inch-long bar controlling the massive
        drill press, forcing the hefty chainsaw bit to gnaw faster into the
        dirty ice, disregarding safety protocols. The bit fought back, sending
        tremors back up the main shaft to warned against pushing the limits of
        coring into a fifty-meter layer of ice on the frozen surface of the
        moon, Europa. Small tools hanging on the thin walls of the miner's shack
        trembled and rattled. A heavy ball pean hammer fell to the cold surface.
        Just a few more meters and the old record for the deepest core would be
        obliterated. It didn't matter who currently held the record, though
        Ulley's name peppered the top ten.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The alarm flashed in his right eye again.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "I got it. I got it. Just a few more seconds," Ulley said. Slight but
        muscular, he pressed all his meager weight down on the handle. Low
        gravity be damned.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The muffs protecting his ears inside his EV helmet crackled with static
        interference. His rapid breaths fogged the glass faceplate. Red warning
        lights commanded an exit from the ice mining site. The extraction would
        supply a year's supply of ice and water for his orbiting habitat. Ulley
        clenched his teeth as he pushed harder. The vibrations on the grinding
        metal drill sputtered and roared, each meter deeper felt like playing a
        game of violent hopscotch.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The muffs crackled. "Halcyon tug ready for liftoff. Cmon, Ulley, let's
        go. The prospect of meeting another like you intrigues even me," Timbre
        said. The old pilot was unflappable and rarely exhibited any emotions
        without the inducement of a liter of stout Miner's ale.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Ulley checked the depth gauge of the core. The numbers slowed. The bit
        was losing too many teeth. Bedrock. Maybe a layer of petrified volcanic
        dust. Just two more meters and he would have it. Another alarm flashed
        on his neural screens. The drill's internal temperature was climbing too
        fast. Abrasion and lousy teeth. A miner's nightmare. He eased back the
        pressure on the control arm. The alarms continued. The cacophony of
        intense vibrations joined with the alarms, and he couldn't concentrate.
        "Shut down all home alarms."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The strobe of the drill alarm continued to increase. Distant voices
        shouted in his helmet. Shut down. Shut down. Go home. Go home. The drill
        handle throbbed in his hand. Carbonite teeth grinding against a hard
        substance transmitted jolts of electricity through his hands and into
        his chest. He eased the downward pressure on the handle. The lightning
        bolts subsided then inexplicably increased to a level Ulley had never
        experienced in his twenty years of ice mining. He pulled back on the
        drill press. Maybe the friction of the teeth ignited a methane pocket?
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Let's go, boss," Timbe said.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "I haven't severed the core yet. Hook on and be ready. No deviations or
        the core will snap."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Oh please. This isn't my first rodeo," Timbre said.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Ulley checked the core depth. Two lousy meters from a record. He poised
        an ocular pointer on the drills control screen. He paused, then blinked
        the command to constrict the chain of drill teeth and chew inward to
        sever the hundred-thirty-two-meter cylinder cored from the frozen moon.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Big bucks for us, my Capitan," Timbre said.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Careful on the x/y axis retraction," Ulley said as he observed the
        extraction of a trillion-ton chunk of ice rising into the vacuum of
        space.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Timbre scoffed, "Please."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The mining shack fell apart as his crew appeared out of the darkness of
        space to grab each of his arms and jabber about his disregard of the
        alarms. His lieutenants pulled him away from the drilling station. Ulley
        shrugged them off to watch the cylinder of ice rise out of the bowels of
        Europa like a stiff worm.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Where to, boss?" Timbre said.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Ulley had pondered an endless number of options and should have made the
        decision weeks ago, before the operation started. Other habitats
        floating in the sea of Jupiter's gravity would pay dearly for the water
        and oxygen. Maybe send the tube to Mars to settle the water futures
        contract he ignorantly signed. Most lunar colonies would outbid any
        competitor. Earth's hegemony with its habitats and satellites starving
        for water might pay even more. His own bioengineered habitat, *Ithaca,*
        stationed above Jupiter's satellite Europa thrived, but an insurance
        policy of additional water was enticing. The alarms sounded and flashed
        again. His wife Pennae's vehement insistence he return as quickly as
        possible made him pause, then smile with the obvious answer.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Home, Timbre," Ulley said. "We have a birthday present to deliver."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The transport shuttle employed a fusion drive and pressed him inside an
        acceleration couch morphing like viscous jelly to form a cocoon around
        his body. He hated leaving Timbre alone to extract and escort the
        cylinder back home. A sudden tectonic tremor might shear off the
        cylinder during the delicate extraction. Or the pilot might face an
        attempt by pirates to hijack the cylinder and resell to one of many
        habitats orbiting Jupiter or Saturn, but those were rare. They had
        completed hundreds of similar extractions with little deviation from the
        prescribed parameters. Ice and air were plentiful, only if one knew
        where to look. Timbre could handle the delivery on his own.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Pennae's pings on his ocular screen became more frantic.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "On my way. Start without me if you have to." Ulley responded.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        *"You fucking pig. You promised to be here."* Pennae shouted through the
        Brainlinq.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The message caused Ulley's head to sink further into the couch as if her
        anger held the equivalent of a dangerous eight gees of acceleration.
        Maybe their decision was misguided. Maybe Pennae had morphed into one of
        those horrible hormonal monsters he had read about. "Docking now. Five
        minutes," he said.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        An agonizing scream sounded deep into his ear canal.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Breathe, Pennae. Breathe."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Fuck you. You breathe," she said between gasps.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "As soon as the airlock opens, I'm there."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Ulley cursed as the shuttle navigated into the docking bay with slow
        precise burns of maneuvering thrusters. He unstrapped the belts and
        rushed to the air lock. Alarms for violating security protocols flashed
        stop signs in his ocular vision. He tapped the keypad with a frantic
        finger. Denied. Denied. Finally, the docking doors spiraled shut behind
        him and he sucked in a great lungful of warm Ithaca atmosphere. This was
        home. The air never lied. The door iris spiraled open and Ulley ran.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        He waved off greetings and gestures from citizens as he sprinted down
        the hallway to the main concourse, turning left into the medical section
        then a few zigzags, racing around a long radius corner with practiced
        precision. He slid on the slick floor of the final turn. A narrow, white
        corridor dead ended in a single door leading to a series of maintenance
        access tubes and emergency escape pods. A child's tiny wail precipitated
        his dirty boots sliding to a full stop against a wall of clear
        poly-glass. He sucked in a big breath. His heart pounded in his chest.
        His rapid breathing paused; his heartbeat faded as he looked into the
        birthing nursery.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Reclining in a luxurious foam couch, Pennae looked up, a naked red-faced
        baby cradled in her arms. Her brow knotted in displeasure softened.
        Ulley raised his hand and pressed it against the glass. His eyes darted
        between the child and Pennae's goddess-like features. Her puffy cheeks
        flushed beneath long auburn hair troubled by the act of childbirth; her
        blue-gray eyes penetrated his soul. He swallowed with no saliva.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Pennae unlatched the baby from her breast to its chagrin and raised the
        naked child like an offering. Ulley's legs buckled. A girl. A daughter.
        The decision to forgo the typical gender reveal, skip a safer exo-womb
        incubation, deny a painless birthing process assisted by Brainlinq,
        waited as a beautiful angel just beyond the glass.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Pennae frowned. She was mad that he had missed the birth. She had every
        right. He followed her eyes, but her brow deepened as her eyes followed
        something behind him.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "I'm coming in. Just hold on till I decontaminate."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Pennae opened her mouth to say something then shuttered her eyes as
        if...
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Congratulations my friend. A momentous occasion."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Ulley turned his head. He stiffened.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Peleus Swale, the chief enforcer for Chancellor Helmut Mintaur and his
        Consortium's hegemony of inner worlds, stood beaming a false smile into
        the nursery. At Pennae, at his daughter. Ulley eyed the killer eyeing
        his family and slid his hand down the glass to find his work belt empty
        of tools to be used as a weapon.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Formal in his attire, a silver suit with a thin red tie hanging on a
        thick barrel chest, Swale coughed. A spray of spittle dotted the glass.
        "So many ways the little ones can expire. Bacteria, viruses, even
        exposure to the endless spectrum of micro-radiation so prevalent out
        here."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Ulley stood erect and stepped closer to a geneered man outweighing him
        by fifty kilos. Swale smirked at Ulley's pitiful posturing then he
        stepped back from the window.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "The Chancellor requests you join the crusade against Troia. Or should I
        say, requires it," Swale said.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Fuck you. I've told him a dozen times we wouldn't join in that idiotic
        crusade. Troia means nothing to me."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        117 light years away, the planet Troia remained a spectacular discovery,
        free from the influence of the Consortium. A home to billions emigrating
        from Earth.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Swale nodded. "But appearances matter. You as the spokesperson for the
        Jupiter Moon Alliance (JMA) refusing to join the fight? Oh, we know how
        that will play out."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Tell him no. Fuck no!" Ulley said. He looked for Pennae, but she was
        gone, with his child.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "The *Argo* sails past in a few hours. She's loaded with kinetic
        harpoons. Hate to see one escape."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Ulley rushed the bigger man and shoved him against the opposite wall.
        The man smelled like a flowering rose garden, a perfume to mask the
        distinct aroma of a Martian sand shower. The enforcers' arms pinned to
        his sides, Ulley pushed his face up to the killers. "Speak plainly.
        Threats are nothing but words. Deceit is nothing but manipulation. Is
        the Chancellor prepared to bomb Ithaca if I don't join his armada of
        fools?"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Swale blinked twice in slow easy repetition. The Chancellor undoubtedly
        watched and listened through the enforcers neural interface.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Swale smirked. "The *Argo* carries new prototype harpoons, and an
        accidental launch could be ruled out. Or Captain Jason might hang for
        ineptitude, or a traitorous spy for Troia might be found. In response,
        the JMA will obviously mobilize their warships and combat shuttles." He
        let the words hang. "Your kingdom ruined. Your command ship *Homer* will
        be found inexplicably unscathed. Awarded to a new captain amicable to
        the Chancellors wishes. The Consortium will direct the JMA to slip into
        the wake of the dreadnought *Agamemnon*. To seek revenge."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Ulley clenched his teeth as his fists tightened against the enforcer's
        hard knotted wrists, but his Brainlinq confirmed the location of the
        battleship *Argo* approaching Jupiter, its current vector unsuited for
        an interstellar launch.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        With lightning quick reflexes, Swale twisted his wrists free, and
        slapped Ulley's hands away then stepped into the middle of the corridor,
        his steel gray eyes narrowing like a predator stalking its prey. Tiny
        clicks signaled weapons embedded in his arms coming online. "I'll give
        you one pass for a birthday present, Ulley. Touch me again and I'll
        personally murder everyone in this habitat." He chuckled mirthlessly.
        "I'll let the Chancellor sort through the blood."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Ulley knew the enforcers' words were not a threat. Hundreds of rumored
        encounters with Swale circulated throughout the solar system like
        fodder, or fable, depending on the point of observation.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Ulley chuckled. A bluff. "You won't get out of this corridor. Kill me
        and the fire suppression system will suck the oxygen out of this section
        before you can get to the next door."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Swale blinked twice, three times. His body turned rigid as he swiveled
        his head to reappraise the surroundings. An opportunity. Ulley lunged
        for the man's throat as if it were a drill bar grinding against bedrock.
        Swale smiled as he swatted Ulley aside, slamming Ulley's face against
        the glass partition.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "And kill our precious new heir?" Swale chuckled. "You and the JMA will
        rendezvous with the fleet in three weeks' time. And make sure that
        lunatic, Patro, and the *Achilles* are with you." He patted Ulley's
        cheek and squinted toward something down the quiet hallway. Ulley turned
        as Swale brushed past him. A scent of fresh air. A scent of Pennae
        followed, infused with innocence and baby breath. Ulley's legs weakened
        with the familiar divine aroma.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The beautiful Pennae shuffled towards him, her tight floral kimono
        requiring tiny little steps, the bundle of cloth held close to her
        breast requiring additional caution. Her eyes aimed lasers at Ulley,
        darted to the enforcers, then back to his.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Swale paused aside Pennae to leer down at the bundle then at her. "So
        precious. So fragile. Congratulations."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        He disappeared before Ulley could swallow.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        <strong>Chapter One</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        <strong>(Five years later)</strong>
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Using a combination of sensor data, advanced AI generated reproductions,
        near-functioning voice communications, Ulley watched the skirmish unfold
        on a holographic three-dimensional screen. The ill-conceived attack
        quickly collapsed beneath the onslaught of plasma beams erupting from
        Troia's planetary defense spheres. Bile rose from his knotted stomach
        into his throat.

        With the exception of increasing animosity within the Consortium fleet,
        Chancellor Helmut Mintaur's strategists and battle-schooled AIs gained
        nothing from the total decimation of three small frigates, and their
        crews. The modifications to their protective ablation shields were a
        complete failure. He ignored an order from the *Agamemnon* for the
        return of the *Home*r*,* back to the swarm of Consortium ships stationed
        in orbit above the massive gas giant, Zeus.

        Ulley winced and ordered his Brainlinq to dispense additional
        suppressants from a neural pharmaceutical package stuck to his neck and
        stem the sickening storm wracking his insides. The *Homer* needed to
        return to the fleets quartermaster stations to refuel, reequip, and
        listen to the incessant grumbling every sailor or soldier would be
        muttering beneath their breath. Possibly rioting if alcohol was
        involved.

        "Nothing new on the attack, Captain." Executive officer Blaylock said
        over the ship-wide communication channel open to all crew members via
        Brainlinq.

        *Of course not. Why would there be?*

        The Consortium buffoons continued to probe the network of defense
        spheres with the goal of locating a single malfunctioning unit out of
        thousand, possibly replicating the pinhole breach Patro and the
        *Achilles* had discovered on its victory lap upon dismantling Troia's
        flagship *Hector* in an epic battle employing alien technology. Patro
        had followed up his victory with the destruction of the dreadnought
        *Priam*. Patro's exuberant celebration silenced by the diminutive
        frigate, *Paris,* matching the Achilles speed and trajectory and firing
        a kinetic harpoon into the heel of the Achilles antigravity nodes. A ton
        of composite stone traveling at a velocity the *Achilles* could neither
        deflect nor escape.

        Ulley double clicked an affirmative response but remained quiet. The
        fifth anniversary of the siege deserved remembrance, along with prayers
        for the dead sailors of the frigates. Useless deaths caused by idiocy.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        His second in command, Blaylock, tapped him on the shoulder, reviving
        Ulley from his morbid thoughts. "Get some sleep, Ulley."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The humanoid Blaylock loomed above Ulley prone in his command couch.
        Rigid as a tree trunk, hairless as a newborn baby, a product of genetic
        engineering and experimental biotech, the man...or construct, had been a
        godsend. Tireless, maybe, ageless, almost, but with a mind that mastered
        spatial constructs, gravitational vectors, velocity, mathematical
        equations, Ulley found tedious with the advent of Brainlinq. Blaylock's
        understanding of alternate universes, parallel dimensions, abstract
        realities, unsolvable concepts waiting to be manipulated like food
        requiring salt.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Yeah. Yeah. Patro had the key. Patro lost the key." Ulley unhooked his
        belt then wobbled as he stood. He waved off Blaylock's assistance but
        looked forward to some serious bunk time.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The dream of Pennae was the first in months, years, maybe. The passing
        of time had become distorted in the dark void of space, lost, and
        incalculable. Sleep and the dreams it brought were incongruous with
        Ulley's unresolved awe of an infinite universe, the boundless void, a
        cold vacuum of death just inches away. But Pennae soothed his worries,
        stroked his wrinkled forehead, kissed a hawklike nose handed down from
        fathers and grandfathers dating back five hundred years.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        He blinked fully awake, Pennae's ethereal presence remained within the
        curl of his fetal body commanding his hand to reach down to the wood of
        his erection. He stroked himself, reliving a fantasy of Pennae striding
        through their bedroom door to open the window shades, the bright light
        penetrating her silky nightgown, cloaking only her tempting finer
        points. Turning to him with an impish grin. The repetitive pulse of the
        Brainlinq signaled his fantasy was terminated.

      <p class="story-text">
        *My wife, lost as I am, waits for me.*

      <p class="story-text">
        Ulley rolled out of the narrow bunk and groaned. He shook the greasy mop
        of hair on his head and inhaled stale air.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Status, XO?" He needed neither the XO's voice nor the status of his
        ship. His Brainlinq hoarded engine function parameters, communications,
        orbital velocity, the vital functions of his own body, the coming and
        goings of his crew, who was screwing who, and maybe why. An omnipotent
        overview of the destroyer, *Homer*.

        He scratched his lengthy beard as he submitted to listening to
        Blaylock's lengthy dissertation of everything he already knew. Francois
        Blaylock had stepped into the role of executive officer with admirable
        quickness and efficiency after the initial assault on Troia.
