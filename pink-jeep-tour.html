        <span class="first-letter">I</span>shoved a curl of stiff wallpaper back
        up to the water-stained ceiling and stuck the corner with a thumbtack.
        Smoothing out the dry gold flecked paisley paper I readjusted the rusty
        metal tack to take in the slack. The crude map drawn on the plaster wall
        and hidden by the wallpaper offered salvation to the human species. Or
        maybe its ultimate demise.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I stepped down off the toilet lid and stared at bloodshot eyes in the
        mirror. The gaunt bearded face staring back at me demanded to call in
        sick for the day. I pushed my face close to the mirror with the tiny
        hope of seeing a flash of the young, vibrant man I used to be, an alpha
        male, a player. Instead, the corruption of metabolizing alcohol yellowed
        my skin, bulged my eyeballs, farmed my cheeks with a blossom of
        spiderwebbed capillaries, my breath was foul. Each night's alcohol
        consumption spelled doom most mornings, yet a prerequisite to find
        paradise. With a painful rotating stretch I cracked my neck bones as a
        familiar rap on the bathroom door said my allotted time in the bunkhouse
        pity pit was up. I flushed rusty water down the toilet and checked my
        khaki uniform. Ava wanted the bathroom, and unless I desired an early
        morning battle, my boss would get it.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I groaned noisily and splashed mildewed sink water on my face and hair,
        the unpleasant aroma sure to silence questions from Ava. I stuck out my
        dry tongue to the mirror then hurried to escape the cramped bathroom. I
        kept my gaze focused on the wooden floor with its dull yellow lacquer
        peeling like the skin of desert reptiles. I wanted no part of Ava's menu
        of expressions, suspicious pity, accusatory, judgmental, scorn, each
        morning different and nuanced, regardless of our previous interaction.
        Ava exhaled a quick dismissive blast of air, her disgust obvious as she
        took my place in the coveted grooming room. The twins, Victor and Vicki,
        waited against the wall of the long narrow hallway. I grunted a "good
        morning" then picked up my backpack and hustled downstairs to the lobby.
        I found my name on a white cooler box filled with lunches and drinks and
        shouldered the strap. I hesitated at an identical box with Ava's name
        tag, tempted to see what madness might ensue if I switched the
        predetermined lunch menus.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The morning was chilled, the desert landscape timeless, the fog of my
        warm breath preceded me with each step. The 500 meter hike up the narrow
        road offered time and clean air to clear out the chardonnay fog clouding
        my head. The silence of the canyon was medicinal and complete. The
        access road tested my heart as the steepness of the grade increased.
        Giant spires of sandstone rose high above hillsides of vibrant juniper
        and mesquite brooding with their magnificence. I tipped my ballcap to
        the hefty sandstone eagle watching over the Chapel of the Holy Cross, a
        focal point for tourists visiting the Sedona Valley, long before all the
        people simply disappeared. I grabbed my knees and sucked in huge gulps
        of air. Four Pink Jeeps idled, spilling a mist of noxious carbon
        monoxide to disappear into the cold air. My coveted position as a tour
        guide with the Time Displacement Consortium was a convenient way to
        muzzle the protests I would have raised back home.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The maintenance manager, Jaxter, stepped from between two of the
        open-air transport Jeeps and chuckled. "Another rough night for the
        Ozzy-man." Jaxter shook his head. "They'll rotate you back out once Ava
        finds proof you know."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I sucked in a last gasp and stood tall. "Maybe I won't go back. Maybe
        I'll live here like a native."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Jaxter smiled wide. "And no doubt you would thrive with so much alcohol
        waiting to be consumed."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I shuttered my eyes and nodded my head. My alcohol use was no secret
        among the cadre of tour guides but Jaxter was not to be trusted. The
        basement in the Chapel Home contained thousands of bottles of wine, just
        waiting to be consumed by someone who might appreciate the nuances of
        vineyard fermentation. I could claim research for a future thesis, and
        no one could dispute my findings.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I offered my free hand to Jaxter, beckoning him to point out which tour
        Jeep to load the cooler box into. He snickered and pointed to PJ201
        idling at the end of the vehicle clique like an outcast. I dropped the
        cooler box into a metal slot atop the passenger seat. I pulled my
        wrinkled and sweat-stained safari hat from my backpack then tossed my
        belongings on the floor beneath the seat. I checked the dashboard for
        fuel, warning lights, mileage calibration, then walked around the rear
        cargo seats checking for trash and misplaced items. Jaxter had done his
        job.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "I'm good, Jax," I said and offered my hands in surrender.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Jax smirked. "The departure pool just paid off on a hundred to one
        longshot for you being first to arrive. Ozzy for the win. I had you,
        brother."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">"Fuck you," I said.</p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The hair on my arms lifted as thunder boomed high in the deep cobalt
        blue sky and lightning crackled in the shadows of massive red rock
        cliffs. I turned my eyes away as brilliant bolts of electricity
        penetrated the roof of the Chapel. The brief storm of time transference
        dissipated, leaving ozone and bitter sulfur to mist the cold crisp air.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">"How about the manifest, Jax?"</p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Sent to you twice already. That booze is fucking with your
        neurotransmitter again."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I shrugged and began a hustle up the slick curved walkway once used by
        humans relegated to using wheelchairs or mechanical assistance. Jaxter
        liked to play games with the passenger manifests, slow play the tourists
        against their special requests, maybe throw a forbidden candy bar into a
        meal meant for the glucose intolerant. A sadistic game played to elicit
        a simple chuckle on his short walk back to the barracks.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The manifest downloaded into my ocular screen. I slowed my approach to
        the chapel proper, assimilating the information dump. The DeMarco's, a
        family with two female children. A family dynamic certain to drain my
        patience before lunch. The Christoph's, a wealthy newlywed couple
        seeking the ultimate rock-climbing adventure would require minimal
        effort. The Casey's, an elder couple searching for a forgotten past,
        sadness and melancholy sure to accompany them at departure. Been there.
        Done that.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        A mixed bag of tourists traveling back from Earth year 3173.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I waited at the open front doors of the chapel. A large bronze statue of
        a man nailed to a faux wooden cross waited in front of picture glass
        windows and stared down at my group, each dressed in identical
        fluorescent pink jumpsuits. I refused to engage with the group standing
        rapt beneath the statues pained expression.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I clapped my hands twice to get their attention. "Welcome to 2033. You
        see before you a monument to the ancient beliefs of an extinct culture,
        and beyond those windows waits one of their cities, unspoiled, one you
        are about to experience as if you lived here a thousand years ago. My
        name is Ozzy, and I am your tour leader. As you know we have strict
        guidelines for this tour. Let's get you loaded into the Jeep then we can
        go over the rules."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The tall male Christoph raised his hand. "We decided on Cathedral Rock.
        The climb requires every minute of time allowed. Will that be a
        problem?"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I offered a grin practiced for years. "Understood M. Christoph. You and
        your partner will find the Cathedral Spires waiting just as the sun
        rises. You are responsible for your own gear, sustenance, and safety.
        Pink Jeep Tours will deliver and return only."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The androgynous man/woman nodded with appreciation.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The elder male, Caddis Winman, checked the others then stepped forward.
        "My wife wants to experience the vortex at the old airport. Just want to
        make sure that's on your map?"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Yes, sir," I said and bowed slightly. The viewpoint was on my map.
        Every stinking trip.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The wealthy Demarco family patriarch pinched his oldest daughter's
        shoulder as if to squeeze out a question. Mira Demarco, fourteen,
        mid-school phenom, enjoined to a caste privileged to experience the
        uniqueness of time travel. A perfect antagonist to foil a mundane day of
        showing the sites.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira stepped forward. "Why did the ancients worship this place?"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        A softball question, one answered easily if their tour leader wasn't
        hungover from an over-tasting of forbidden wine. "Miss DeMarco… ah,
        Mira, I'm sure you have that answer in your data files but I can expand
        upon what you have downloaded as we proceed to the vehicle."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I offered my hand towards the door to usher my small herd forward. Mira
        was the first tourist to exit and paused to gape upon the pristine red
        rock cliffs and towers.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I introduced the Sedona landscape. "Take in the grandeur of Sedona as
        you make you way down the ramp. The confluence of seven major energy
        vortexes and countless smaller ones will explain why this is one of only
        two sites on the planet capable of sustaining the rigors of time
        displacement. You will feel the subtle energy of each vortex as we visit
        them up close."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The slog down the walk was slow, as usual. Fingers pointed up to Eagle
        rock overlooking the Chapel, Mira traced the outline of Snoopy Rock for
        the others to understand. Thunder exploded as lightning sizzled and
        crackled above the chapel as the next group arrived. I directed the
        group to climb up the Jeeps three step ladder and sit on benches in the
        cargo area of a vehicle foreign to them, regardless of the instructional
        vids they had probably ignored.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira was helped in first, and she checked the seats, the views, then sat
        behind the driver seat, within earshot to ask incessant questions. My
        daughter Chloe might have done the same, had she lived to see her teen
        years. Climbing ropes and equipment loaded. Check. Passengers loaded.
        Check. Vehicle status nominal. Check.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Each morning the awe-inspiring landscape of Sedona saved me, often
        muting the redundant questions of tourists sprinkling their conversation
        with wealth, status, superior positions within our authoritarian
        government. Their own existence dwarfed by the timeless red cliffs and
        massive towers jutting up from a desert of scrub and mesquite. I stepped
        on the gas pedal to get the Christoph's to Cathedral Rock before the
        sunrise. The dizzying tight switchbacks didn't help but we reached the
        trailhead with light to spare. The oblong parking area was crammed with
        abandoned automobiles displaying monikers from different districts.
        Colorado. Missouri. California. I often wondered about the interactions
        between denizens of so many districts, did they squabble or assert
        dominance based on their locations.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        My group today was gracious as they helped the climbers with their ropes
        and gear to the base at a tower of red sandstone soaring high into a
        clear sky. The slight detour might have caused dissension, animosity, a
        bevy of negative emotions until I reminded the group to be mindful of
        the major energy vortex residing within the enormous tower of stone.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira grabbed my index finger and held on as we descended cut stone steps
        at the base of Cathedral Rock. I tried to pull my finger away but her
        small hand held tight. The same grasp my nervous four-year-old daughter,
        Ciri, used as I escorted her to a classroom on Lunar Colony Six. One.
        Two. Five steps and my resistance relaxed. I wondered if Ciri would
        still hold my hand had she not been killed in a shuttle accident along
        with my wife eight years ago, or was it a thousand years from now, to be
        relived, over and over again.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">"You never answered my question," Mira said.</p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "You tell me," I said. I checked the others stepping carefully down the
        fenced walkway, making sure shoe tracks in the silty sand were the only
        thing that remained. Gangly and in the throes of puberty, Mira would
        challenge everything I said.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira cleared her throat. "Jesus embodied the hopes of a species destined
        to perish. Science was the paganism of His time. Now He is the pagan.
        Kinda simple if you ask me."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I smirked but kept moving forward. Youth thrived on simple answers.
        "What if Jesus was exactly what old religions deemed him to be. Can you
        say for sure He didn't swoop down and take his people back to heaven."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Now you're just being obtuse," she said and ran ahead to the Pink Jeep.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The group loaded into the vehicle, I steered down an asphalt road with
        switchback curves jackknifed into the steep hills. I slowed to point out
        foraging javelinas, a coyote skulking in the shadow of a juniper, and a
        slow-witted tortoise determined to block the road and mangle my
        schedule. At a dead-end of the road, I made a stop in a cul-de-sac with
        a single domicile gated off from entry and attached to a large field of
        tall grass blending into the dense Oak Creek bottomland. A herd of
        genetically unmodified black cows grazed.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira stood up quick and pointed towards a stand of dense cottonwoods.
        "What are those?"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I smiled. "Horses. Extinct in our world. The big black one is the
        stallion, and the others are mares."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">She squinted with confusion.</p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Males and females. The females follow the male," I said.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">Mira groaned.</p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The tour continued along the main highway, where I explained the tourist
        economy and the shops advertising mystic crystals and aura photographs.
        We found gravel turnouts offering panoramic vistas of Thunder Mountain,
        Steamboat Rock, Coffeepot Rock, silent, lonely monoliths waiting and
        watching for visitors.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        We parked in the shade of enormous elm and cottonwood trees, and I set
        up a table stored unnoticed in the cargo hold. The rushing water of Oak
        Creek steps away, I distributed lunchboxes to my people sitting
        patiently at a picnic table. In this land of abundance, I watched the
        group slurp algae steak and kelp sandwiches transported from home. I
        turned my back and stare at crystal clean water soothing a course
        downstream.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira broke the quiet peacefulness. "All that water wasted. No wonder
        they became extinct." She surveyed the faces at the table. Her subtle
        challenge was unmet.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I kept my eyelids shuttered as the creeks gurgling offered a calming
        influence on my psyche. Yet the demands of my job description said an
        answer was required. "Alright. We have a tight schedule and need to get
        going. Mira, can you gather those lunch packs and place them on the
        Jeeps tailgate for reconciliation. Please check around for any items you
        might have missed and lets get going. Lots to see."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira sneered. "You didn't answer my question again. Maybe Ava would have
        been a better guide."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The pubescent girl obviously carried within her neural implants
        petabytes of data concerning the era's relevance to our own culture and
        environmental issues. I turned on the combative girl, a teen flailing to
        wield her immense intelligence. "You didn't offer a question. Only an
        observation. Rephrase and resubmit." I waited. The others gathered at
        the tailgate, the metal ladder waited for my command to unfold the
        steps.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira narrowed her eyes and nodded. "Water is life. Why did the current
        culture waste so much water?"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I nodded acceptance of her query. "This water you see sustained more
        than just the dominant species of humans. These trees, grass, the
        animals we have seen, this water sustained all. The water we have back
        home is… limited…a precious resource to be managed much differently than
        what you see here."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Yes. But they could have stored all this and found ways for future
        generations to use it. They could—"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">"They did what they thought was best," I said.</p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Then they were fools. Just like you." Mira crossed her arms and joined
        her family, trying to hide within a mix of bright pink suits.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        We drove to Chimney Rock, circled Sugarloaf Mountain and up into Boynton
        Canyon with its infamous energy vortex. My narration and stories were
        true and by the book. Mira peppered me with questions about the geology,
        fauna, and flora. Her tone sought to find untruths or fabrications in my
        answers. None to be had. I steered the Jeep into a trailhead parking lot
        used by visitors to the Palatki ruins, an abandoned settlement of native
        Americans.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira jumped from the vehicle and sprinted for a dirt path marked by
        warning signage and trail maps. She glanced back at me with narrowed
        eyes then sprinted up the silty trail. I looked back at her father, but
        he merely closed his eyes and shrugged. Her neurotransmitter signal weak
        but sufficient for me to broadcast a shutdown command. Mira froze, her
        left foot inches from the sharp spikes of a prickly pear cactus. I
        climbed out and walked up beside her, studying her face. Her blue eyes
        darted about. Her nostrils flared. I tilted my head and pressed my face
        close to hers. Her kelp sandwich wafted from her breath.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Her adolescent conditioning had failed, a mind-warping education
        designed by the world government to reign in dissent and prevent
        rebellion by the next generation. Mira wasn't angry at me, she was a
        normal teenager, searching for her own identity, angry with the bleak
        conditions of her future. No one could blame her – but no one could
        rescue her either. I circled her then feigned to press the nodule of her
        implant, a reset to total compliance.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I whispered in her ear. "You can't escape your future running in the
        past." The exact words I was required to tell her. Then I repeated
        myself. "You can escape the future running in the past."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I pulled my face back and studied Mira's eyes. Blue as an ancient ocean.
        Alive and searching for the reason of my misspoken words. Soulful
        innocent eyes, a reminder of my dead child.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Except I didn't believe my own words. Sipping wine, memorizing trails
        and roads on Arizona maps by candlelight in the basement, an escape into
        the past was forbidden. And still I planned to live my life in the past.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I released the paralyzing hold on Mira. Her boot struck the cactus and
        broke a nopale off from the main stem. A transgression requiring her
        immediate return to the Jeep and the time portal. She looked up at me
        with horrified eyes, her jaw dropped. Her words died before reaching her
        lips.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Just return to the vehicle. No harm, no foul. Unless you choose to
        continue," I said.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        She turned quickly and hurried back to the Jeep. Protocol dictated I
        report the improper behavior and her damage to the cactus. A single
        cloud suddenly shaded the bright afternoon sun, casting a pale dullness
        over the brilliant red desert. I kicked the nopale into the dense growth
        surrounding the cactus and returned to the vehicle.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Our arid home, one Mira would return to in just hours, was void of clean
        water, absent of vegetation or forests, with most humans living
        underground, surviving beneath artificial sunlamps, unless you counted
        the Lunar and Mars colonies still striving for a sustainable existence.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The group sat quietly as I steered down deserted roads and through
        vacant subdivisions capable of housing thousands. I announced one final
        stop before we would rendezvous with the climbers and return to the
        portal. I kept the Jeep's speed to a crawl as we ascended a steep grade
        to the Sedona Airport, allowing the group to absorb the grand vista
        expanding with each meter of elevation. We stopped at a worn gravel
        pullout where they could climb a steep sandstone knoll to view Bell
        Rock, Cathedral Rock, Courthouse Rock, the Oak Creek bottomland and
        experience the Airport Energy Vortex. Mira avoided my eyes as she held
        her younger sister's hand and ran ahead. I lagged the group, allowing
        them absorb a splendor unseen in their current time zone. Mira and her
        family stood close together, as any family on vacation might.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The Casey's waited arm in arm, the elder couple had smiles stretched
        across their wrinkled faces. The setting sun reflected off the abundant
        sandstone cliffs miles away, bathing the elder couple in the solar
        energy of a vortex. The old man nodded at me to come over and I obliged.
        The spectacular panorama belittled me, humbled my thoughts of having to
        return to the a depressing world.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The old woman finally spoke, her voice confident and sure. "Billions of
        people disappear in a flash. What do you think happened to all the
        people?"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        A question asked a thousand times. I crossed my arms across my chest.
        "It's all conjecture but the reasons run the gamut of alien abduction
        all the way to the outlawed Theory of Rapture. Nothing—"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        She had turned her head to stare deep at my eyes. The golden red glow of
        the sunset glinted off her dull gray eyes. "You. What do you think
        happened? A beautiful world such as this and ninety-nine percent of our
        species simply disappears?"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I swallowed grit and wished I was sitting back in my vehicle. Maybe the
        energy vortex loosened my tongue, maybe the wine had killed too many
        brain cells, maybe I didn't care what came out of my mouth anymore. "I
        can't really say for sure. But I think the time displacement mechanism
        finding this exact place and time offers a new beginning for our
        species. Infrastructure, roads, farms, utilities, everything intact and
        waiting to be claimed. A chance to live free like our ancestors, only
        cleaner, smarter, a sustainable future our primary goal."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mr. Casey cleared his throat. "The government would be wise to listen to
        you when you return. Probably mulch you for the algae vats instead."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        A tiny gasp escaped my mouth. I turned to return to the vehicle, pausing
        to see the silhouettes of a small family admiring the view, one missing
        Mira. I searched the hillsides and the heavy vegetation below before
        spotting the girl sulking in the back the Jeep. I moved down and climbed
        into the driver's seat to sit quietly and enjoy the absolute silence
        accompanying the approaching twilight. Mira slid the soles of her shoes
        over fine sand coating the metal floorboard, a grating sound sure to get
        my attention.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I stared at the dashboard. If I looked at her then I might begin to fear
        my own return to the future, but answers to my questions would not be
        ignored. "Why'd you pick the Palatki trailhead to run? Bullshit me and
        your father will have to carry you back up to the portal."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        A huge exhale. "It was the most north on the tour. Closest to the
        boundaries where—"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Where you would become lost, dehydrated, and fodder for the coyotes."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira whispered a weak sarcastic retort I chose to ignore.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "You would've been better served to take off at our picnic area. The
        creek would've masked the sound of footsteps, the big trees would have
        shielded you from surveillance. And the saved your skin from the burning
        sun. Downstream you would have found plenty to eat at the abandoned
        farms and ranches. Then you would've found the railroad tracks. You know
        about railroads. An ancient invention that opened this land to
        colonization a thousand years ago. All kinds of different railroads out
        there. After that, who knows."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira shifted to sit behind the passenger seat. "How would you know?"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I ignored her question. "With time travel experience on your resume you
        could apply for a tour leader position within a few years. A glowing
        recommendation from a Pink Jeep guide and imagine what a young, spirited
        mare might bring to this position."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">"I'm not a freaking extinct horse."</p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I chuckled. "No, you are not. Bullheaded but not a horse."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "You'd really write a recommendation? Even after—"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Even after," I said. "But remember to research railroads. Especially
        the underground railroad of the 1800's. Maybe find others interested in
        that particular type of railroad."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        We enjoyed long minutes of silence together before the others climbed
        into the jeep. A ten-minute drive and we found the two climbers waiting
        at the Cathedral Rock trailhead parking area. Gear catalogued and
        checked, I took a slow meandering drive up the access road, letting the
        group admire and inhale the last vestiges of an unparalleled journey.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The Chapel of the Holy Cross loomed as we emptied the jeep. Hands
        shaken, hugs squeezed, goodbyes said. Ava beckoned the group up to the
        time portal.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Mira stood to the side, a wraith unaware of her haunt, then she stood in
        front of me, a malicious smile on an impish face. She pressed a tiny
        obsidian arrowhead into my hand. "I would have made it." She ran to
        catch her family.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I looked down at the trinket commonly found in the curio shops lining
        the main streets, a stop forbidden by the commission and one we never
        made. She must have found the arrowhead at a trailhead or on the path at
        Cathedral Rock. Maybe her father or mother had known she was going to
        flee and had given it to her.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        My field reports filed with Ava, I returned to the two-story manor the
        tour guides and maintenance crew used for sleeping quarters. I slumped
        onto my small bunk and stared at the posters of Arizona pinned to the
        old planks of cedar covering the walls. Maps showing roads, elevations,
        rivers and creeks, mineral mines, forests and low elevation deserts. The
        great chasm of the Grand Canyon prominent at the top of each. My eyes
        grew heavy then my door opened. Ava slipped in and closed the door
        behind her. Her tongue probed her cheek as her eyes pitied me. She
        removed her safari hat and shook her hair to fall onto her shoulders.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "Your replacement arrives with tomorrow's guests then you go home," Ava
        said.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">I stiffened. "I am home."</p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "You've had too many runaways, Ozzy. Pack your things and be ready first
        thing in the morning." Her eyes challenged me. To protest, or argue, or
        grovel.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">I shrugged. "Whatever."</p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Ava waited long seconds then turned and departed.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I thought about Mira and her family. Did they have something to do with
        my termination? I shook off the possibility. Two years as a tour guide
        and I had chalked up fourteen runaways that had not been recovered. But
        the other guides had seen equal numbers. I put my hands behind my head,
        laced my fingers and stared at the large map of Arizona pinned to the
        ceiling. A hundred thousand square miles of remote wilderness just
        waiting to be explored. Those runaways would never be found.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        My body weary and my heavy eyelids said a nap was in order. The night
        would be long and arduous.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The scent of wood smoke drew me to the encampment. I crouched behind an
        escarpment of basalt boulders spiced with colorful pumpkin lichen and
        watched a group of people busy with the daily chores of survival.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Three weeks ago, I had stuffed my backpack with the tools needed to
        survive my escape from Sedona. My biometric tracking chip ran haywire
        from the weeks of over-indulgence of wine, allowing me time to cut the
        chip from just beneath the skin at my temple. Blood oozed down my face,
        frightening me until the crude surgery clotted and blood flow finally
        stopped. I buried the microchip in a foot of sand then constructed a
        rock cairn as a tiny monument to my freedom.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I had taken my own advice to Mira. I followed the Oak Creek bottomland
        downstream to the confluence with Verde River. The unfiltered creek
        water rattled my bowels for three days then subsided. The canopy of old
        growth elms and cottonwoods shielded any attempt to find me from above.
        I moved south, perpendicular to the sun, at night if possible. Unnerved
        by the sudden crack of twigs, hoots of unseen creatures perched in the
        treetops, a symphony of howling coyotes, I kept my feet moving until a
        pair of rusty metal rails overgrown with luscious green grass crossed my
        path and led me west into a brilliant orange sun casting shadows into
        the past.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        A few days later a line of empty wine bottles blocked my path yet
        directed me to a viewpoint.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I pushed my face forward and recognized the tall skinny man emerging
        from a wide mouthed cave entrance nestled beneath a broken cliff face
        diffusing the woodsmoke. Raymond, the tour guide I had replaced took off
        his safari hat and waved it at me. I stood up and raised my fists to
        signal my victory. I hurried down the slope of loose basalt scree and
        was greeted by a group of men, women, boys and girls, some still wearing
        fluorescent pink jumpsuits. Each wore a tiny arrowhead around their
        neck, or in a hair clip, even as earrings.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        People clapped me on the shoulders and arms. Infectious smiles of joy. I
        recognized a few faces, runaways from previous Sedona tours. Raymond
        shook my hand vigorously. "We were getting worried about you. A group of
        your escapees just headed towards Prescott yesterday to start a new
        community. They're gonna be happy to see you again."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        "I can't wait," I said. "Oh, and I brought a gift for the camp." I
        removed my backpack and pulled out a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon and
        offered it to Raymond.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        Raymond cradled the bottle in his hands as if it were a newborn child.
        He chuckled. "A 2006 Caymus…I haven't seen one of these in…in two
        thousand years. We'll enjoy this tonight then set the bottle free to
        join our railroad signal."
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        He pushed his face close to mine, a pleasant perfume of woodsmoke
        drifted into my nostrils, his brown eyes intense. "Will there be more
        coming, I mean, other runaways?"
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        I shook my head. "I don't know. A few had possibilities. I threw out
        some subtle hints and directions. I planted seeds. Let's see what
        happens." I truly did not know how to answer his question. The Sedona
        tours might stop temporarily with my escape. Stricter controls
        implemented. A governmental show of absolute authority to intimidate
        future escape attempts. Short term solutions. But the popular tours
        would continue. And people would find a better world.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        A leather cord with Mira's curio dangled from the zipper on my backpack.
        The fingernail of black obsidian arrowhead continued to haunt me. How
        Mira came to possess the forbidden stone was confounding.
      </p>

      <p class="story-text">
        The tenacious rebellious nature of her youth might yet provide her a new
        beginning. Perhaps for all of us.
